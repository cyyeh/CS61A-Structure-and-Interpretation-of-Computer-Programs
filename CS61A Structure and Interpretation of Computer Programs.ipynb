This is not to say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task. But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. The significance of higher-order functions is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.\n",

For example, the line `count = ...` in counter, is creating the local variable `count` inside `counter`'s frame. This assignment statement tells Python to expect a variable called `count` inside `counter`'s frame, so Python will not look in parent frames for this variable. However, notice that we tried to compute `count + 1` before the local variable was created! That's why we get the `UnboundLocalError`."

    "- When `next` is called but there are no elements left in the iterator, a `StopIteration` error is raised. In the for loop construct, this exception is caught and execution can continue.\n",

You can also call `iter` on the iterator itself, which will just return the same iterator without changing its state. However, note that you cannot call `next` directly on an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the `iter` and `next` functions in action with an iterable we're already familiar with -- a list.\n",

    "### Iterable uses\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that lists are one type of built-in iterable objects. You may have also encounter the range(start, end) function, which creates an iterable of ascending integers from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> for x in range(2, 6):\n",
    "...     print(x)\n",
    "...\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranges are useful for many things, including performing some operations for a particular number of iterations or iterating through the indices of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some built-in functions that take in iterables and return useful results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map(f, iterable)` - Creates iterator over `f(x)` for `x` in iterable\n",
    "- `filter(f, iterable)` - Creates iterator over `x` for `x` in iterable if `f(x)`\n",
    "- `zip(iter1, iter2)` - Creates iterator over co-indexed pairs (x, y) from both input iterables\n",
    "- `reversed(iterable)` - Creates iterator sequence containing elements of iterable in reverse order\n",
    "- `list(iterable)` - Creates a list containing all x in iterable\n",
    "- `tuple(iterable)` - Creates a tuple containing all x in iterable\n",
    "- `sorted(iterable)` - Creates a sorted list containing all x in iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator function returns a special type of iterator called a generator. Generator functions have `yield` statements within the body of the function instead of `return` statements. Calling a generator function will return a generator object and will not execute the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the following generator function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    print(\"Beginning countdown!\")\n",
    "    while n >= 0:\n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "    print(\"Blastoff!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `countdown` will return a generator object that counts down from `n` to 0. Since generators are iterators, we can call `iter` on the resulting object, which will simply return the same object. Note that the body is not executed at this point; nothing is printed and no numbers are output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> c = countdown(5)\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "<generator object countdown ...>\n",
    ">>> c is iter(c)\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is the counting done? Again, since generators are a type of iterator, we can also call `next` on them! The first time `next` is called, execution begins at the first line of the function body and continues until the `yield` statement is reached. The result of evaluating the expression in the `yield` statement is returned. The following interactive session continues from the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> next(c)\n",
    "Beginning countdown!\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike functions we've seen before in this course, generator functions can remember their state. On any consecutive calls to `next`, execution picks up from the line after the `yield` statement that was previously executed. Like the first call to `next`, execution will continue until the next `yield` statement is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> next(c)\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> next(c)\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you predict what would happen if we continue to call `next` on `c` 4 more times?\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate calls to `countdown` will create distinct generator objects with their own state. Usually, generators shouldn't restart. If you'd like to reset the sequence, create another generator object by calling the generator function again.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> c1, c2 = countdown(5), countdown(5)\n",
    ">>> c1 is c2\n",
    "False\n",
    ">>> next(c1)\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> next(c2)\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A generator function has a `yield` statement and returns a generator object.\n",
    "- Calling the `iter` function on a generator object returns the same object without modifying its current state.\n",
    "- The body of a generator function is not evaluated until `next` is called on a resulting generator object. Calling the `next` function on a generator object computes and returns the next object in its sequence. If the sequence is exhausted, `StopIteration` is raised.\n",
    "- A generator \"remembers\" its state for the next `next` call. Therefore,\n",
    "    - the first `next` call works like this:\n",
    "        - Enter the function and run until the line with `yield`.\n",
    "        - Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.\n",
    "    - And subsequent `next` calls work like this:\n",
    "        - Re-enter the function, start at the line after `yield`, and run until the next `yield` statement.\n",
    "        - Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.\n",
    "- A generator should not restart unless it's defined that way. But calling the generator function returns a brand new generator object (like calling `iter` on an iterable object).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful tool for generators is the `yield from` statement (introduced in Python 3.3). `yield from` will yield all values from an iterator or iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> def gen_list(lst):\n",
    "...     yield from lst\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> g = gen_list([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    ">>> next(g)\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> next(g)\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> next(g)\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> next(g)\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> next(g)\n",
    "StopIteration\n",

    "  SELECT [val5]             , [val6]             , ...;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: You do not need to repeat the AS keyword in subsequent SELECT statements when creating the table.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example where we construct a table with the `CREATE TABLE` statement. `UNION` is used here to join rows and `AS` assigns a table column to a new name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Football AS\n",
    "  SELECT 30 AS Berkeley, 7 AS Stanford, 2002 AS Year UNION\n",
    "  SELECT 28,             16,            2003         UNION\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have created a table called `Football`, which has three attributes (columns): `Berkeley`, `Stanford`, and `Year`. We can later access the values from this table by referencing the table's columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create tables from existing tables, the `SELECT` command references another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting From Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "More commonly, we will create new tables by selecting specific columns that we want from existing tables. `SELECT` statements can include optional clauses such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM`: tells SQL which tables to select values from\n",
    "- `WHERE`: filters by some condition\n",
    "- `ORDER BY`: enforces an ordering by some attribute or attributes (usually a column or columns)\n",
    "- `LIMIT`: limits the number of rows in the output table\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT [columns] FROM [tables] WHERE [condition] ORDER BY [attributes] LIMIT [limit];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes about the arguments:\n",
    "- `[columns]`: a comma separated list of the columns to select, * can be used to select all of them\n",
    "- `[tables]`: a comma separated list of tables to select values from\n",
    "- `[condition]`: a Boolean expression\n",
    "- `[attributes]`: a comma separated list of attributes, which are usually columns, but could also be named aggregates (which we will learn later)\n",
    "- `[limit]`: an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "We can select all the values of an attribute from a table with the `SELECT` statement. In addition, we can apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause. Here, we filter by `Year > 2002`, which makes the `SELECT` statement keep only the rows in the table whose `Year` value is greater than 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sqlite> SELECT Berkeley FROM Football WHERE Year > 2002;\n",

    "- booleans: `AND`, `OR`\n",

    "### Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use joins to include rows from another table that satisfy the `WHERE` predicate. Joins can either be on different tables, or the same table if we include an alias. Here we are referencing the football table twice, using `AS` to bind the football table once as the alias `a` and once as the alias `b`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this query asking for?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that it does not seem like we actually performed any operations to do the join. However, the join is implicit in the fact that we listed more than one table after the FROM. In this example, we joined the table `Football` with itself and gave each instance of the table an alias, `a` and `b` so that we could distinctly refer to each table's attributes and perform selections and comparisons on them, such as `a.Year < b.Year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of a join is that it produces a cross-product between the two tables by matching each row from the first table with every other row in the second table, which creates a new, larger joined table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an illustration of what happened in the joining process during the above query.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the select statement examines the joined table and selects the values it desires: `b.Berkeley - a.Berkeley` and `b.Stanford - a.Stanford` but only from the rows `WHERE a.Year < b.Year`. This prevents duplicate results from appearing in our output and also removes rows where the years are the same."
